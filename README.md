# Purpose

In this repo set up a [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) example blog, which is 
build and deployed using [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions).  
The initial intend was to find a way to do this using 
[stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/). I haven't figured out a way yet.

# Resources

The following resources were useful for learning about Github actions in combination with
Haskell and Hakyll:
